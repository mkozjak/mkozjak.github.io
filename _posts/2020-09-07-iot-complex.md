<em>Hypergrowth</em> of global connectivity in the early 2010s inevitably forged path to further development of devices deployed on customer premises and industrial environments. Communication between <em>them</em> and remotely located services became a thing.

New IoT platforms were built due to an ever-growing demand of connecting embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone to the <em>Internet</em>. They started tackling challenges of remote management, big data storage, analytics and over-the-air updates. With great success. Number of startups base their products on top of them. But <em>not</em> without any drawbacks, obviously.

**A challenge**

The majority of these platforms provide you with means of connecting your devices to their offering, giving you the possibility of management and supervision. What they *lack* in is taking care of your devices from the OS level *all* the way up to your business logic.

There's also a very *small* number of platforms that provide you with the toolkit your IT department can use to surpass that challenge. A drawback using these solutions is having an expectation for you to have *vast* software engineering expertise.

There *must* be a middle ground here. Businesses focusing on Operational Technologies (OT) should be able to implement complex solutions in the Cloud utilizing Information Technologies (IT) to a degree sufficient to satisfy their business case without deviating too far from their expertise and losing focus.

**A drive towards the improvement**

Areas that must be covered in such a platform are:

 * Device provisioning and onboarding
 * Over-the-Air system updates
 * Secured communications and vulnerability scanning
 * Automated application deployment
 * Cloud-native, resilient environment

Engineers shouldn't face this many layers straight into the beginning of their projects. Yet completely ignoring these areas early on in the process might result in *huge* technical debts. IT environments should be <u><a href="https://www.elpheria.com/products/edgebind/#turn-into-manageable">architected well in order to be resilient, secure and manageable</a></u>.

We need to plan ahead to easily scale in future.
