"I started listening to <em>alternative rock</em> and <em>metal</em> back in elementary school. MTV was largely responsible for me getting into new bands and music. I've also been learning music composition for <em>fifteen years</em>. Things like chord progressions, riffs, singing techniques, and important song structures. Mostly in the metal genre, but with some singer-songwriter acoustic stuff too."

"Rock and metal musicians generally start writing their songs in <em>English</em>. We've all been raised on English-language music, so that's the <em>default</em>. But the issue with English is that it's not my native tongue. No matter how good my English gets, it's really <em>hard</em> to get all the emotion out as I can in Croatian."
