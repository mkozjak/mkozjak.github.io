### What an experienced DevOps practitioner can do for you?
Common scenarios where I deliver successful projects:
- migrate your on-prem applications to the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- package your applications into Docker containers
- import and configure your current cloud infrastructure with Infrastructure-as-Code using tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation
- automate your testing and deployment processes creating Cl/CD pipelines using platforms such as Jenkins, Travis-CI
- implement Git techniques such as GitHub Flow or Gitflow to split your application deployments between production, staging, QA and development environments
- scale your applications using managed container services such as AWS ECS and GCP App Engine or managed Kubernetes services such as AWS EKS and GCP GKE
- secure your application environments defining least-privilege IAM policies for your workloads and safeguarding your APIa using firewalls and CDN/Load Balancing services
