### What an experienced DevOps practitioner can do for you?
Common scenarios where I deliver successful projects:
1. Provide guidance on software development and deployment methodologies in the early stages of your project
2. Implement Git techniques such as GitHub Flow or Gitflow to split your application deployments between production, staging, QA and development environments
3. Scale your applications using managed container services such as AWS ECS and GCP App Engine or managed Kubernetes services such as AWS EKS and GCP GKE
4. Secure your application environments defining least-privilege IAM policies for your workloads and safeguarding your APIa using firewalls and CDN/Load Balancing services
5. Implement custom solutions for your products
6. Automate your testing and deployment processes creating Cl/CD pipelines using platforms such as Jenkins, Travis-CI
7. Migrate your on-prem applications to the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
8. Package your applications into Docker containers
9. Import and configure your current cloud infrastructure with Infrastructure-as-Code using tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation
